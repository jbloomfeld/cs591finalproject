All files have been tested to run in Python 2.7. Simply run

python <script.py> <graph file>

where <graph file> contains a separate entry on each line defining an edge between two nodes in the graph, i.e.:
<node 1> <node 2> [edge weight]

The output of the scripts is a collection of discovered graph clusters, one per line.
